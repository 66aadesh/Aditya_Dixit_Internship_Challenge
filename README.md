## Tasks Overview

### Task-01: K Means Clustering
- Perform K Means Clustering on a given dataset.
- Analyze the dataset using scikit-learn.
- Implement K Means Clustering model and predict clusters.
- Export the results to a CSV file.

### Task-02: Model Training and Evaluation
- Train machine learning models (K Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest) on given datasets.
- Evaluate the models using test datasets.
- Compare the accuracy of different models.
- Export the model predictions and evaluation results to CSV files.

### Task-03: Data Transformation and Analysis
- Clean and transform data from a CSV file.
- Perform exploratory data analysis.
- Calculate duration metrics and analyze activity patterns.
- Export the analysis results to a CSV file.
